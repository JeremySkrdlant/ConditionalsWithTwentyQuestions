# ConditionalsWithTwentyQuestions
Small conditional tutorial using the game of twenty questions

## Rules of the Game
Begin by pairing up with another student.  Have them put in a location but make sure you can not see them enter the data. 

Then you ask a question by typing in the diamond.  Diamonds in flowcharts represent decisions. 

Next the other student clicks yes or no based on the answer of your question.  All your questions need to result in either a yes or no answer. 

## The Code 

Feel free to look around at the code.  There are comments explaining different parts where we used if then statements.
